# ecommerce-app

## Description

This is a PERN application, with a Postgres database, Node/Express backend, and React frontend. 

Work in progress. See commits/code for details. 

Application is under active development and usually gets at least 1 commit per weekday. Finish date set for early/mid March. 

## How to use

You can find the link to the hosted site on the right, under the "About" section.

When you create an account, please use mock data only when it comes to sensitive data (email, address, payment data, etc.). 

ATTENTION: THIS WILL NEVER BE A "REAL" STORE. For fun and portfolio purposes only. No real products are on display, and payment process will be entirely mocked.
